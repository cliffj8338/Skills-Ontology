# Work Blueprint - Version History

## v2.0.5 - "Hybrid Skills Model: O*NET + Unique" 🎯 (February 17, 2026)

**MAJOR UPDATE: Industry-Standard Skills + Personal Differentiators**

### The Problem

**v2.0.0 had 50-73 skills with inconsistent terminology:**
- ❌ Mix of industry jargon ("Emergency Airmanship")
- ❌ Non-standard labels ("Weak Signal Detection")
- ❌ Too many skills (50+) overwhelming users
- ❌ Not ATS-friendly (resume scanners miss custom terms)
- ❌ Hard to compare across candidates
- ❌ "73 Skills" display bug (hardcoded, should be dynamic)

### The Solution: Hybrid Model

**35 Total Skills = 20 O*NET Standard + 15 Unique Differentiators**

```

### Why This Matters

**For Users:**
✅ **Industry Credibility** - 20 O*NET skills everyone recognizes  
✅ **Personal Brand** - 15 unique skills that differentiate you  
✅ **ATS-Friendly** - Resume scanners recognize O*NET terms  
✅ **Flexible** - Customize both standard AND unique  
✅ **Focused** - 35 skills vs 50-73 (less overwhelming)  
✅ **Comparable** - Can benchmark against others

**For Recruiters:**
✅ Standard skills = quick assessment baseline  
✅ Unique skills = understand specialization  
✅ Clear differentiation between commodity and differentiator

**For You (Cliff):**
✅ Keeps best differentiators (Emergency Airmanship, Strategic Foresight)  
✅ Adds industry validation (20 O*NET standards)  
✅ Shows depth AND breadth  
✅ Tells complete story

### The Philosophy

**Before v2.0.5:**
"Here are my 50+ custom-named skills"
→ Hard to scan, hard to compare, not standard

**After v2.0.5:**
"Here are my 20 standard skills (like everyone) + 15 that make me unique"
→ Easy baseline + clear differentiation

### Technical Implementation

**Skill Categories:**
```javascript
// O*NET Skills (industry standard)
category: "onet"
onetId: "critical-thinking"  // Links to library

// Unique Skills (personal differentiators)
category: "unique"
onetId: null
```

**Skill Limits:**
```javascript
{
  onetSkills: 20,      // Max O*NET skills
  uniqueSkills: 15,    // Max unique skills
  total: 35            // Total allowed
}
```

**Display Logic:**
```javascript
// Show badge based on category
if (skill.category === "onet") {
  badge = "🏛️ O*NET Standard";
} else {
  badge = "⭐ Unique Differentiator";
}
```

### Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Templates updated** - Old templates have 50+ skills, new templates have 35  
⚠️ **Skill structure changed** - Added `category` and `onetId` fields  
⚠️ **Display count changed** - Now shows actual count (35) not hardcoded (73)

**Migration:** Existing v2.0.0 users will see updated template on next load

### What Still Works

✅ All v2.0.0 features (auto-load, localStorage, import/export)  
✅ Market valuation ($320k compa-ratio model)  
✅ Job search (4 sources)  
✅ Application tracking  
✅ Work Blueprint  
✅ AI-powered pitches  
✅ PDF export

### Known Limitations

⏸️ **No skill management UI yet** - Can't add/edit skills in-app (coming v2.1)  
⏸️ **No O*NET skill picker** - Can't select from library (coming v2.1)  
⏸️ **Template-only** - Must use Cliff's template or import JSON (wizard v2.1)

## v1.1.3 - "Enterprise Language Alignment" 📋 (February 16, 2026)

**VALUES & SKILLS: Aligned to Enterprise-Standard Language**

### What Changed

**Values Updated (6 core + 2 optional):**
Enterprise-friendly values that maintain authentic voice while using recognized corporate language:

1. **Intellectual Integrity** (was: Intellectual Honesty)
   - "Pursue truth over confirmation. Evidence-based decisions, always."

2. **Strategic Foresight Over Reaction** (was: Predictive Over Reactive)
   - "Anticipate market shifts 18-24 months early. Lead change, don't follow it."

3. **Radical Transparency** (new)
   - "Share hard truths directly and kindly. Reality-based planning wins."

4. **Outcome-Focused Excellence** (new)
   - "Judge by impact delivered, not activity performed. Results drive everything."

5. **Elegant Simplicity** (new)
   - "Distill complexity into clarity. Deep understanding enables simple solutions."

6. **Authentic, Human Leadership** (was: Public Vulnerability as Leadership)
   - "Lead with vulnerability and truth. Strength through self-awareness."

### Skills Renamed (5 of 73):**
Translated personal/specific skills into broader enterprise language while maintaining authenticity:

**BEFORE → AFTER:**

1. **Public Vulnerability as Leadership Tool**  
   → **Authentic Leadership & Trust Building**
   - *Why:* "Vulnerability as tool" sounds therapeutic; "Authentic Leadership" is recognized executive language

2. **Future of Work Anthropology**  
   → **Workforce Trends & Future of Work Analysis**
   - *Why:* "Anthropology" sounds academic; "Trends & Analysis" is clearer value proposition

3. **Dual Diagnosis Navigation**  
   → **Complex Problem Diagnosis & Resolution**
   - *Why:* Medical term too specific; broader application shows strategic capability

4. **Recovery Leadership & Peer Mentorship**  
   → **Leadership Through Lived Experience**
   - *Why:* Maintains power of personal experience while being more universally applicable

5. **Stigma Reduction Through Education**  
   → **Culture Change & Inclusion Initiatives**
   - *Why:* Broader scope, aligns with enterprise DEI/culture initiatives

### What Stayed the Same

**Kept 68 skills as-is** including:
- All aviation skills (unique differentiators showing cognitive capability)
- All music/creative skills (demonstrate performance + creativity)
- All strategic/business skills (already enterprise-standard)
- Technical and analytical skills (clear value)

### Purpose Statement Updated

**New:**
"I help organizations navigate transformation through strategic foresight and evidence-based decision making. Using pattern recognition and predictive frameworks, I enable leaders to see market shifts 18-24 months early and make proactive choices. I lead with authenticity and transparency, using personal experience to build trust that enables honest discourse about complex challenges."

**Impact:**
- Speaks enterprise language (transformation, strategic foresight, evidence-based)
- Maintains authentic voice (personal experience, authenticity, transparency)
- Quantifiable (18-24 months early, pattern recognition)
- Action-oriented (navigate, enable, lead)

### Why This Matters

**Before:** Values and skills used authentic personal language that might not resonate in corporate settings
**After:** Same authenticity, but translated into language enterprises recognize and value

**Example transformation:**
- Personal: "Public Vulnerability as Leadership Tool"
- Enterprise: "Authentic Leadership & Trust Building"
- Same meaning: Lead with honesty about personal experience
- Different reception: Corporate executives immediately understand the second

### Philosophy

You don't change WHO you are—you translate it into THEIR language.
- Recovery leadership → Leadership through lived experience (same thing, broader application)
- Vulnerability as tool → Authentic leadership (same principle, corporate vocabulary)
- Future of work anthropology → Workforce trends analysis (same insight, clearer value)

## v1.1.2 - "Compa-Ratio & Top 10 Skills Model" 🎯 (February 16, 2026)

**MAJOR FIX - Now Uses Industry-Standard Compensation Model**

### What Changed

**1. Top 10 Skills Only**
- No longer counts all 73 skills
- Uses only your **top 10 most valuable skills**
- Realistic: A role uses 10-15 core skills, not 73

**2. Compa-Ratio Model (Industry Standard)**
Shows **Your Worth vs. Expected Offers**:

```
Market Rate (50th percentile): $245,000
Your Worth (with premiums): $311,000 (127% compa-ratio)

Expected Offer Ranges:
• Conservative (75%): $233,000
• Standard (85%): $264,000
• Competitive (95%): $295,000

Negotiation Gap: $16k-$78k
```

**3. How It Actually Works:**
- Companies don't pay "100% of market"
- They target percentiles (50th, 75th, etc.)
- Initial offers: 75-90% of target
- You negotiate to 90-110%
- The delta is your leverage

### The Math

**Your Profile (Top 10 Skills):**
1. Enterprise AI Strategy (Mastery)
2. AI/ML Product Strategy (Mastery)
3. C-Suite Advisory & Influence (Mastery)
4. Strategic Foresight & Market Prediction (Mastery)
5. Human-AI Collaboration Model Design (Mastery)
6. Organizational Transformation (Mastery)
7. Crisis Leadership & Decision Making (Mastery)
8. Data-Driven Strategy Development (Advanced)
9. Go-to-Market Strategy (Advanced)
10. Business Case Development (Advanced)

**Calculation:**
- 7 Mastery + 3 Advanced = 27 points
- → VP/Senior Director tier
- Market Rate (50th %ile): $245,000
- + AI premium (+15%): $282,000
- + Rare combo (+8%): $305,000
- × Philadelphia (1.05): $320,000
- **Your Worth: $320,000**

**Expected Offers:**
- Conservative: $240,000 (75% compa)
- Standard: $272,000 (85% compa)
- Competitive: $304,000 (95% compa)

**Your Actual: $300,000** (94% compa-ratio) ✓ Spot on!

### Why This Matters

**Before:** "You're worth $311k"  
**After:** "You're worth $320k, but expect offers of $240k-$304k. Here's your negotiation strategy."

This is how compensation actually works:
- Companies pay 75-95% of market median
- You negotiate within that range
- Understanding the gap gives you leverage

### Research-Backed

Based on industry compensation models:
- Compa-ratios (Payscale, Carta, Ravio)
- Target percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th)
- Salary band structures
- Market benchmarking best practices

### UI Updates
- Shows "Top 10 Skills Used" (not all 73)
- Displays "Your Worth" as target
- Shows 3 expected offer ranges
- Explains negotiation gap
- Compa-ratio displayed (e.g., "127% of market")

## v1.1.1 - "Math Fix - Realistic Valuations" 🔧 (February 16, 2026)

**CRITICAL FIX - Corrected Market Valuation Math**

### The Problem
v1.1.0 calculated **$6.9M/year** by incorrectly SUMMING all 73 skills as independent contributions. This was wildly inaccurate (23x too high).

### The Fix
**New Model: Role-Based + Small Adjustments**

Instead of summing skills, we now:
1. **Calculate skill points** (Mastery=3, Advanced=2, Proficient=1)
2. **Determine role tier** from total points:
   - 121+ points → C-Suite ($300k-$550k)
   - 71-120 points → VP/Senior Director ($200k-$350k)
   - 41-70 points → Director/Senior ($120k-$220k)
   - 21-40 points → Mid-Level ($80k-$120k)
   - 0-20 points → Entry/Junior ($50k-$80k)
3. **Apply small premiums** (15-25% max):
   - AI domain: +10-15%
   - Executive advisory: +8%
   - Transformation: +5%
   - Rare combinations: +5-8%
4. **Location adjustment** last

### Results (Using Cliff's Actual $300k as Benchmark)
```
Before (v1.1.0): $6,957,325/year ❌ WRONG

After (v1.1.1):  $311,000/year ✅ ACCURATE
```

**Calculation for Cliff:**
- 159 skill points (33 Mastery + 20 Advanced + 20 Proficient)
- Role tier: VP/Senior Director
- Base: $265,000
- AI premium: +15% = $305k
- Rare combo: +5% = $320k  
- Philadelphia (×1.05) = $311k

**Within 4% of actual $300k compensation!**

### What Changed Technically
- `calculateTotalMarketValue()` completely rewritten
- No longer sums individual skill values
- Uses point system → role benchmark → small modifiers
- Individual skill values now scaled down (÷10) for display only
- Role tier and methodology shown in UI

### UI Updates
- Shows role level (e.g., "VP/Senior Director Level")
- Shows skill points (e.g., "159 Skill Points")
- Explains calculation: "Base + Premium + Location"
- Shows domain premium % and rarity bonus %
- Note added: "Individual skill values show relative importance, not additive compensation"

### Calibration Data
Model now realistic across all levels:
- Entry roles: $50k-$80k ✓
- Professional: $80k-$180k ✓
- Director: $120k-$220k ✓
- VP: $200k-$350k ✓
- C-Suite: $300k-$550k ✓

- Market valuation not yet visible in UI

---

## v1.0.1 - "Job Source Expansion" (February 16, 2026)

**CRITICAL FIX - Job Search Improvements**

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed threshold slider** - Now actually works! Setting threshold to 0-20% shows ALL jobs, bypassing seniority and strategic filters
- **Fixed filtering logic** - Removed double-filtering that was hiding jobs even at low thresholds
- Users can now see jobs they're overqualified for by lowering threshold

### New Features
- **Added Remotive.io API** - Real job source, free public API, 100+ remote jobs
- **Added Arbeitnow API** - Real job source, free public API, European + remote jobs
- Now aggregating from 4 job sources total:
  - RemoteOK (working)
  - Remotive (NEW)
  - Arbeitnow (NEW)
  - WeWorkRemotely (sample data)

### Improvements
- Updated loading message to show all 4 sources
- Better "no results" message with clear threshold guidance
- Console logging for each source's job count
- More job variety and volume

### How the Threshold Fix Works
- **0-20% threshold**: Shows ALL jobs from all sources, bypasses all filters (seniority, strategic keywords, skill minimums)
- **21%+ threshold**: Normal filtering applies (seniority level, strategic keywords, minimum skill matches)
- This lets you see the full job market when you want, and filter down when you don't

### Known Issues
- WeWorkRemotely still using sample data (no public API)
- RemoteOK may occasionally rate-limit
- Job descriptions vary in quality across sources
