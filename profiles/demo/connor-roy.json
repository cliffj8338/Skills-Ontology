    "location": "Santa Fe, NM / New York, NY",
    "roleLevel": "Executive",
    "headline": "Renaissance man and gentleman entrepreneur who has pursued excellence across politics, agriculture, theater production, and lifestyle hospitality. First son of media titan Logan Roy, with a lifelong commitment to proving that privilege and purpose can coexist.",
    "executiveSummary": "The eldest Roy sibling who chose to build his own path outside the Waystar Royco empire. Connor has pursued a remarkably diverse portfolio of ventures — from a working cattle ranch in New Mexico to a Broadway theater production to a presidential campaign. While results have been mixed, his persistence, genuine warmth, and refusal to become cynical despite a lifetime of being underestimated make him uniquely positioned for diplomatic and relationship-intensive roles."
