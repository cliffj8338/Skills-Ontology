    "roleLevel": "Mid-Career",
    "headline": "Single mother and retail professional who has demonstrated investigative tenacity, crisis leadership, and protective determination that would put most federal agents to shame. When institutions failed, she didn't.",
    "executiveSummary": "A retail worker and single mother whose professional resume barely hints at her true capabilities. When her son disappeared and every authority said he was dead, Joyce refused to accept it and conducted her own investigation that proved correct. She has since navigated government conspiracies, traveled to Soviet Russia, and rescued people from interdimensional threats \u2014 all while working retail and raising two boys alone."
